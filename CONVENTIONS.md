# Conventions

## Status language

Use **current** only for implemented and verified behavior, **proposed** for a design under review, and **planned** only when a tracked work item commits to delivery. Do not present the README's proposed API, security properties, runtime support, or package names as shipped functionality.

## Repository boundaries

1. Import only documented public core APIs. Keep the dependency one way: reversible may depend on core; core, adapters, and benchmarks may not depend on reversible.
2. Do not copy detector rules, policy tables, overlap logic, or typed formatter logic into this repository.
3. Never treat a visible placeholder or type label as a bearer capability. Authorize every restore against application-supplied identity, session, tenant, purpose, and destination.
4. Do not turn a core `block` outcome into a restorable entry. Document any other eligibility policy explicitly.
5. Keep logging and tracing integrations redaction-only. A restore feature must not be introduced through adapters.

## Package boundaries

The portable `vault` package may own in-memory mappings and final-application restoration but must not claim that browser code can authenticate another tenant or defend against compromised same-page scripts. The `vault-server` layer owns multi-principal source-to-sink authorization and all-or-nothing restore preflight; it may use memory or a qualified external store. A `store-*` package supplies a backend under the shared lifecycle and atomicity contract; it must not bypass server authorization. A store holds ciphertext only: it never decrypts, holds a key, or evaluates policy. A `key-provider-*` package wraps data keys and never sees a payload. Only those two kinds of package may name a database driver or a key-service SDK ([specification](docs/specs/persistent-vault.md) §2). Keep browser bundles free of server-only and backend SDK dependencies.

Npm names apply to JavaScript only. Maintain language-neutral security requirements and shared adversarial cases for future Python, Rust, and Go surfaces. Do not claim an unimplemented language is supported.

## Security-sensitive changes

Before changing token identity, value capture, storage, authorization, or restore semantics, update the threat model and relevant decision record. Add negative tests for forged, expired, revoked, cross-session, cross-tenant, and policy-changed requests; include failures and cancellation. Use only unmistakably synthetic or revoked values in tests and documentation. Do not log original or restored values, raw mappings, sensitive exceptions, or raw input in CI output.

Treat memory erasure, encryption-at-rest, one-time use, and exact TTL values as claims requiring an implementation and evidence, not slogans. Prefer small public interfaces with explicit behavior under failure. A consumer's existing vault and identity policy must be injectable without silently weakening invariant checks.

## Documentation and decisions

Keep each README to what a consumer needs in five minutes: what the package is for, how to install it, one working example, and the rules that example depends on. Task walkthroughs go in `docs/guides/`, full API and operational detail in `docs/reference/`, and versions and qualified runtimes in `docs/status.md`. Keep ARCHITECTURE.md for trust boundaries, and `docs/decisions/` for durable choices and rejected alternatives. Each decision records status, scope, consequences, and questions left open. Link to the core's canonical documentation instead of copying its API or detector inventory. Documentation and tests should change with behavior.

## Releases

Publish independently of the core. A supported core version range requires integration tests at both ends. Do not claim browser, Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, CLI, persistent store, streaming, or host integration support until each is implemented and qualified.

## Interoperability changes

Change [vault-interop-v1](docs/specs/vault-interop.md) and versioned shared vectors together when altering token/capture/authority semantics. Keep native traits, optional development bridges, and named production qualification separate. Consumer findings never replace Vault authorization and a reference fixture never establishes native Rust Vault support.
