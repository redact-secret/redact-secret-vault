"""Client for the qualified service boundary to ``@redact-secret/core``.

See ``boundary/core_bridge.mjs`` and the "Python core bridge" section of
docs/specs/threat-model.md for why this boundary exists: no native Python
distribution of the core is published (verified against the
``redact-secret/redact-secret`` GitHub organization), so this package must not
reimplement detection (AGENTS.md, CONVENTIONS.md). Detection happens entirely
in the pinned ``@redact-secret/core`` JavaScript package, run in a long-lived
Node.js process that the bridge owns; this module only parses the safe
finding metadata (id/type/detector/confidence/obfuscation/start/end/action)
that the core's public ``scan`` API returns, never a matched value.

``CoreClient`` is a ``Protocol`` so a caller may substitute a fake in unit
tests (see ``tests/test_server_authority.py``) or, in the future, a
differently-qualified boundary (an HTTP microservice fronting the same core,
for example) without changing ``InMemoryVaultServer``.

class NodeCoreBridge:
    """Calls the real ``@redact-secret/core`` in a long-lived Node.js process.

    Threat boundary: this class trusts the local ``node`` executable and the
    npm-installed ``@redact-secret/core`` (or a caller-supplied
    script/executable).

    Core location: ``node_modules`` (or, when it is ``None``, the
    ``REDACT_SECRET_VAULT_NODE_MODULES`` environment variable) names the
    ``node_modules`` directory the application installed the core into, for
    example with ``npm install @redact-secret/core@<PINNED_CORE_VERSION>``.
    The bridge then loads ``<node_modules>/@redact-secret/core`` and nothing
    else: no parent directories and never the working directory. With
    neither set, the bridge script resolves the core relative to its own
    location, which works in this repository and when the virtualenv lives
    inside the project that installed the core, but not for a
    ``pip``-installed package whose site-packages is elsewhere. A directory
    that does not hold the core raises ``CORE_FAILURE`` with ``core_code``
    ``BRIDGE_CORE_NOT_FOUND`` (``BRIDGE_CORE_LOAD_FAILED`` if it is found but
    fails to load); so does a missing core without either setting. It is a
    server-side, same-host integration only, not qualified for
    browser/Worker/CSP contexts. It never passes a fixture, secret, or
    matched value back to the caller; the core's ``scan`` API structurally
    cannot return one, and the bridge script projects each finding to its
    eight safe metadata fields.

    Process lifetime (#89): each bridge owns at most one Node.js process at
    a time, started on the first ``scan`` and reused by later ones. Requests
    and responses are newline-delimited JSON frames with a per-process
    request id that the response must echo. A lock admits one request at a
    time, so threads sharing a bridge are serialized and each waits for the
    one ahead of it; separate bridges own separate processes. The process is
    killed as soon as it has served ``max_scans_per_process`` scans
    (``1`` gives one process per scan), and replaced before a request once
    it is ``max_process_age_s`` old or has been idle for half of
    ``idle_timeout_s`` (the process exits on its own after the full idle
    time, so a request never races that exit). It is killed and discarded
    after any request that does not end in a well-formed success response,
    including a timeout, a crash, a malformed or oversized frame, a
    bridge-reported error, a version or PII-activation mismatch, and an
    interrupted call. The next ``scan`` starts a new process. ``close()``,
    the context manager, garbage collection of the bridge, and interpreter
    exit each kill and reap the process; the process also exits when its
    stdin closes, so it never outlives the Python process. After a
    ``fork()``, the child never uses the parent's process and starts its
    own. The process's stderr is discarded.

    Core integrity: ``expected_core_integrity`` (default ``PINNED_CORE_INTEGRITY``) pins the "rsv-tree-v1" digest of
    the package directories the bridge is about to load: ``@redact-secret/core``, ``@redact-secret/wasm``, and the
    platform addon package that Node.js finds beside them. The first request of each process carries the pins; the
    process hashes those directories before it imports the core, so a core that was replaced or modified never runs and
    never sees an input, and any difference (a changed, added, removed or symlinked file) is ``CORE_FAILURE`` with
    ``core_code`` ``CORE_INTEGRITY_MISMATCH``. The response reports the digests it verified and this class checks them
    against the pin again. What it covers: every file of those directories, and that a native addon the core chose was
    one of them (an addon found through ``NODE_PATH`` or a global folder is refused). What it does not cover: the
    ``node`` executable, the bridge script, other directories on Node.js's module path, and a change made between the
    hash and the import by someone who can write those files. ``None`` switches the check off, as
    ``expected_core_version=None`` does the version check; a core other than the pinned release needs both.

    PII activation (docs/decisions/decide-pii-retention-and-activation-ownership.md
    §3 "Python bridge"): each bridge process is a realm with no other
    initializer, so ``pii`` is the only selection and omission means PII
    off. ``pii`` is forwarded verbatim to the core's ``initialize({ pii })``
    when a process starts; the core owns selector grammar and its
    ``PII_SELECTOR_*`` rejections surface as ``CORE_FAILURE`` with
    ``core_code``. A non-empty ``pii`` on a core without a PII surface
    (beta.9) raises ``PII_UNAVAILABLE``. Every response, from every process
    this bridge starts, reports ``piiActivation`` and is compared with
    ``expected_pii_activation`` when that is set (``PII_UNAVAILABLE`` if the
    core reports none). Otherwise the identity from the first successful
    response is pinned and every later response must match, so a replacement
    process that came up under a different core fails. A difference raises
    ``PII_ACTIVATION_MISMATCH``.

    Failure behavior: a malformed ``pii``, ``expected_pii_activation``,
    ``timeout_s``, or lifetime setting raises ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` and a
    missing ``node`` executable raises ``UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME``, both at
    construction. A request frame over ``MAX_REQUEST_FRAME_BYTES`` raises
    ``LIMIT_EXCEEDED`` before it is sent. A request that passes
    ``timeout_s`` (``BRIDGE_TIMEOUT``), a process that cannot start
    (``BRIDGE_SPAWN_FAILED``) or exits mid-request
    (``BRIDGE_PROCESS_FAILED``), a malformed, oversized, or out-of-sequence
    response (``BRIDGE_BAD_OUTPUT``), and a core-version mismatch
    (``CORE_VERSION_MISMATCH``), and a core that is not the pinned release byte for byte
    (``CORE_INTEGRITY_MISMATCH``) each raise ``VaultServerError(CORE_FAILURE)``
    — fail-closed, never a partial or best-effort finding list. A ``scan``
    after ``close()`` raises ``CORE_FAILURE`` with ``BRIDGE_CLOSED``. No
    error carries the input, a selector, a path, or process output.

    Residual risk: a compromised local ``node`` binary or a supply-chain
    compromise of the installed ``@redact-secret/core`` package would affect
    this boundary exactly as it would affect the JS vault. A process now
    serves many requests, possibly from different callers sharing the
    bridge, over its lifetime; see the threat model's "Python core bridge"
    section for why no request can observe another's input or findings.
