Hide secrets from a model, then put them back where you allow it.

[Redact Secret](https://github.com/redact-secret/redact-secret) finds secrets in text and redacts them for good. This repository adds the opt-in way back: `capture` swaps each secret for a random token before the text leaves your code, and `restore` swaps the tokens back, but only into the fields you named in advance.

**Status: beta.** In-memory use is published for JavaScript and Python. Persistence is alpha and published on npm. The Python persistent modules ship in `redact-secret-vault` `0.1.0b4` behind extras and are not supported, verified only for the cells of their [qualification record](docs/research/qualification-python-persistence-0.1.0b3.md), which shows the Node.js bridge (plaintext retention not met at the default `max_scans_per_process`) and the support matrix not passed in full. The runtimes and versions each language was run on, and how the two servers differ: [JavaScript and Python matrix](docs/research/js-python-conformance-and-runtime-matrix.md). Details: [release status](docs/status.md).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install @redact-secret/vault@0.1.0-beta.6
```

npm also installs the one `@redact-secret/core` version this release works with.

```ts
import { createVault } from "@redact-secret/vault";

const vault = await createVault({ pii: [] }); // pii: [] = PII detection off

// 1. Capture: say where the values may come back.
const captured = vault.capture("Rotate ghp_SYNTHETICxREVOKEDxTESTx0000000000000 today", {
  release: [{ sink: "reply", paths: ["body"] }],
});
// captured.text === "Rotate <rsv_…> today"

// 2. Send captured.text to the model. It sees only tokens.
const modelReply = `Done: ${captured.text}`;

// 3. Restore: tokens become values again, in the granted sink and path only.
const { fields } = vault.restore({
  sink: "reply",
  captures: [captured.captureId],
  fields: { body: modelReply },
});
// fields.body === "Done: Rotate ghp_SYNTHETICxREVOKEDxTESTx0000000000000 today"

vault.dispose(); // 4. Drop everything when the task ends.
```

Pin the exact version while the packages are beta. More programs you can run as they are: [examples](examples/README.md).

## Which package do I need?

| You are building | Use | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A browser app, a CLI, or a server handling one user per vault | `@redact-secret/vault` | [README](packages/vault/README.md) |
| A server with many users or tenants | `@redact-secret/vault-server` | [README](packages/vault-server/README.md) |
| A Python server | `redact-secret-vault` (PyPI) | [README](packages/vault-py/README.md) |
| A server whose captures must survive a restart or be restored by another process | `@redact-secret/vault-server/persistent` (alpha) | [Persistent server guide](docs/guides/persistent-server.md) |

The persistent profile is built from smaller packages you only meet in that guide: [`store-postgres`](packages/store-postgres/README.md), [`store-sqlite`](packages/store-sqlite/README.md) (partly qualified, see the [record](docs/research/qualification-store-sqlite-0.1.0-alpha.1.md)), [`store-memory`](packages/store-memory/README.md), [`vault-crypto`](packages/vault-crypto/README.md), [`key-provider-aws-kms`](packages/key-provider-aws-kms/README.md), [`vault-contracts`](packages/vault-contracts/README.md), and [`vault-conformance`](packages/vault-conformance/README.md).

## Five things to know

1. **Nothing is kept unless you call `capture`.** Installing or importing a package retains nothing.
2. **A token is not a permission.** A value comes back only into the `sink` and `paths` the capture granted. On a server, your policy also checks the user, tenant, and purpose on every restore.
3. **A restore is all or nothing.** One bad token denies the whole request and returns no values. Keep the redacted text and do not retry with a wider grant.
4. **Values are short-lived.** Every entry expires, and each token restores once by default.
5. **Redacted does not mean safe.** The core does not detect every secret, and code running in your page or process can read what the vault holds. See the [threat model](docs/specs/threat-model.md).
